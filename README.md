### A personal finance dashboard that actually looks good
I got tired of spreadsheets. So I built this — a dark, minimal finance dashboard that connects to your real bank accounts via Plaid and gives you a proper breakdown of where your money is going.
Built with Next.js, PostgreSQL, too much coffee, and a mind that it withering away in unemployment.

## What it does

- **Connects to your bank** via Plaid Link — works with most major institutions
- **Categorizes transactions** automatically across 10+ spending categories
- **Spending breakdown** — donut chart so you can see exactly where the money is leaking
- **Monthly trends** — 6 months of spending history in a bar chart
- **Top merchants** — ranked by how much you've given them your money
- **Transaction search** — filter by category, date range (7/30/90 days), or keyword
- **Account balances** — all your accounts in one place, real-time

## Getting it running

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL
- A free Plaid dev account

### 1. Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CosmoJelly/finance-dashboard.git
cd finance-dashboard
npm install
```
### 2. Environment variables
Fill in `.env.local` with your keys:

```env
# Plaid
PLAID_ENV=sandbox

# PostgreSQL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://yourusername@localhost:5432/finance_dashboard

### 3. Set up the database

```bash
createdb finance_dashboard
npm run db:migrate
```

## Plaid Sandbox
When the Plaid modal pops up, pick any bank and use these credentials:
```
Username: user_good
Password: pass_good
```

It'll populate around 90 days of realistic (fake) transaction data instantly.

## Database schema

Three tables, pretty straightforward:

```sql
plaid_items  (id, user_id, item_id, access_token, institution_name)
accounts     (id, item_id → plaid_items, account_id, name, type, current_balance)
transactions (id, account_id → accounts, transaction_id, amount, date,
              name, merchant_name, category[], primary_category, pending)
```
